0.9359	When the refrigerator recovers pawer after a pawer failure.the ice bucket may contain
0.9318	a mix af melted and jammed ice cubes.which can prevent the ice maker from working
0.8907	properly.To prevent this.make sure to empty the ice bucket so the ice bucket can reill
0.9969	Operations
0.9529	with fresh.loose ice cubes.

0.9324	To remove the ice bucket,see the lce bucketapplicable models only section on page 45
0.9754	NOTE
0.9541	Removal of the ice bucket does not affect the thermal and mechanical performance of
0.9452	the refrigerator.
0.9680	Water clouding
0.9390	Water supplied to the refrigerator flows through a core alkaline filter.During this filtering
0.9586	process.the water pressure of the water increases and the water becomes saturated with
0.9416	oxygen and nitrogen.This causes the water to look misty or cloudy temporarily when
0.9416	dispensed.This is normal and the water will look clear after a few seconds.
